## Interesting web site for **software engineering**

### My Choice of interesting website is [here](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/).

>What I find interesting about the website is that it not only focuses on 
the technical side of software engineering but also the business side of engineering.
Also, the website allows me to keep in touch of the trends that are going on in the 
software engineering industries and some of the strategies that other companies are
starting to, or trying to integrate into their technology stack. Not only that,
the website manages to organize many of its articles into popular topics such as
Cloud, Data, Blockchain.
